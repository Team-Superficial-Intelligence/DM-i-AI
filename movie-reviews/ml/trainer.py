    The Trainer class is used for training a model instance based on the Model class found in ml.model.py.
    In order to get started with training a model the following steps needs to be taken:
    1. Define the Model class in ml.model.py
    2. Prepare train data on which the model should be trained with by implementing the _read_train_data() function and
    the _preprocess_train_data() function
